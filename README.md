# Stock-Analysis Project.
**For our project, we analyzed full sets of data from the stock markets for 2017 and 2018. Also during the analysis, we refactored the challenge "Dataset code" that was provided.  After the refactoring process, I deduce that the script runs faster in about 0.87 seconds for the year 2017 while in the year 2018 runs about 0.89.**
## Results
**All Stock Year 2017**
